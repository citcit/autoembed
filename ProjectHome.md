AutoEmbed is a utility and service that generates HTML embed tags for a given URL. It also provides the means to optionally manipulate the retrieved media information by setting parameters, and finally returning a reconstructed HTML snippet for presenting Flash video on a website.

  * Translate any given URL (from a supported video site) into an embed HTML snippet
  * Is very lightweight and does not depend on any external libraries
  * Available as a single PHP class, easily includable in your own projects
  * Supports over 150 audio & video sites (with more being added often)
  * Provides easy error checking in the event that a URL is not valid

Some programming is required. AutoEmbed is available as a web service for performing URL to Embedded Video conversions, and is available for download as a PHP class, licensed under the LGPL.
